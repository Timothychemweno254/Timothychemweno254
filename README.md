🎓 Education
Moringa School | Full-Stack Engineering
Focus: JavaScript → Python/Flask pipeline

Key Wins:

Built 3+ production-ready apps in 6 months

Mastered React hooks + API design patterns

SQLAlchemy > Raw SQL (ORM gang)

📌 What’s Next?
Ship it! → Deploy UrbanHire/StudyStorm

Go Full-Stack → Integrate Flask into 2 projects

Open Source → Contribute to a Python/React lib

Level Up → Dockerize everything 🐳

✨ Dev Mantra
“Clean code > clever code. Break things, but log it first. CTRL + S is my heartbeat.”

🎯 Why This Works?
Tech-Driven: Keywords like ORM, CRUD, JWT, Atomic CSS scream competence.

Energy: Phrases like "WIP", "soon™", and "ORM gang" add personality.

Ambition: Shows you’re hungry (Flask → Docker → Open Source).
